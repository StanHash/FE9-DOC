yeppy yep there's C++ in here, which means that there's some ABI stuff to clear up.

Thankfully it seems to me that this is all very similar to what I've already figured from Harvest Moon: Friends of Mineral Town (except it's PowerPC instead of ARM).
HM-MFOMT C++ notes: https://github.com/StanHash/FOMT-DOC

vtable refresher:
	vtable header layout:
		+00 | word | for mutiple inheritance; offset to add to the "inner" instance pointer to get the "full" object pointer
		+04 | word | probably dummied-out rtti info

	+08 and beyond is where the function pointers lie.

	When layout out vtables around the doc, I'll omit that part (it's almost always going to be two zeroes anyway) and only keep the function pointers.

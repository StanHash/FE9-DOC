NOTE:
	A "PID" is a character identifier (person? id)
	A "JID" is a class identifier (job id)
	A "SID" is a skill identifier (skill id)
	A "FID" is a face (portrait) identifier (face id)

	+018 | float | ?
	+01C | some struct
	... (this is all probably display stuff I don't understand)
	+180 | word  | address of prev unit in faction's linked list (0 if first?)

	+188 | word  | address of CharacterInfo
	+18C | word  | address of ClassInfo
	+190 | word  | address of Faction
	+194 | word  | address of resuce Unit (probably)
	+198 | byte  | index in Unit Array
	+199 | byte  | ?
	+19A | byte  | level
	+19B | byte  | exp
	...
	+19E | byte  | map x (probably)

	...
	+1BC | 128bits | skillset (think of it as one big bitfield)
	+1CC | Item[4] | weapons
	+1EC | Item[4] | items

FE9 Unit state bits:
	bit 0  : force deployed?
	bit 1  : cannot be moved in prep screen?
	bit 3? : is dead?

Faction struct:
	+00 | word | first unit in linked list
	+04 | word | leader unit?
	+08 | byte | id?

FE9 Faction id:
	0 : blue?
	5 : non-deployed blue?

FE10 Unit struct:
	+000 | short  | ?
	...
	+0E4 | word   | address of prev unit
	+0E8 | word   | address of next unit
	+0EC | word   | address of char info
	+0F0 | word   | address of class info
	+0F4 | word   | address of faction (struct)
	+0F8 | word   | address of rescuing unit (unsure, assuming same as FE9)
	+0FC | byte   | index (unsure, assuming same as FE9)
	...
	+108 | 64bits | unit state bits (unsure, seems to also be used for some skills, but this may be like "is using this skill" (like gamble) and not "has this skill")
		hi 20 : parity? nihil?

At 802F04E0 there's an array of a lot of the following struct

FileEntry struct: (sizeof() == 0x7C)
	+00 | char[] | normalized path cstring
	+2C | word   | hash37 of normalized path
	+30 | short  | flags
		bit 14 | has children? TODO: investigate
	+32 | short  | some count
	+34 | word   | last used time (in quarter seconds?)
	+38 | word   | address of data

Flags:
	(flags & C00):
		C00 = cmp file
		800 = pak file
		400 = cms file
	& 400 = cms file

Path normalization:
	(one) leading '/' is removed.
	All uppercase characters are converted to lowercase.

At 802ADB20+8 is an array of hash table buckets, which are just pointers to those:
	+00 | word | address of data
	+04 | word | hash31 of identifying string

cstr hashing function: (function at 8000D598, also inlined at multiple other locations)
	int hash37(const char* cstr)
	{
		int result = 0;

		while (*cstr)
			result = result * 37 + *cstr++;

		return result;
	}

	hash31 is the same exact function with the constant 37 being replaced by 31.

Getting bucket id function: (I don't really know why that works but I tested it and it does)
	int get_bucket(const u32 hash37)
	{
		static const u32 magic = 0x80C121B3u;
		return hash - (((u64)hash * magic) >> 40u) * 509u;
	}
